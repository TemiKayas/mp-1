      <h3>Above is an image of me recieving the Antonis Fragoudakis Memorial Award in 2024</h3>
      <p>This award was given to me during my time as a research assistant, I worked on a team figuring
      out how we could best integrate AI to help teach Modern Greek. I worked with Professor
      Polychroniou (Middle) and her student Spiro Capatos (Right)</p>

      <h3>Above is the Google IT certification.</h3>
      <p> I received this certification back in my senior year of high school. There was a program
      to give students an oppurunity to earn this certificate and I was more than happy to take
      part in the program. Many of the skills I learned from this program I still use to this day</p>
